# Engineering Simulations: Learning Journey

This repo tracks my progress learning computer-aided engineering (CAE) using simulation tools like ANSYS.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand core concepts in FEA (Finite Element Analysis) and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
- Learn simulation through hands-on ANSYS case studies
- Develop intuition about physical principles behind simulations
- Document key ideas and learnings for future reference

## 📚 Sources

- "A Hands-On Introduction to Engineering Simulations" (Cornell University)
- Additional resources from CAE/FEA/CFD guides

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `lectures/`: Contains lecture transcripts and structured notes
- `notes/`: Contains summaries and key "big ideas" behind simulations

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- ANSYS 16.2 (as used in the course)
- Markdown (for documentation)
