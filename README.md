# 🧠 Engineering Simulations — Learning Repo

Welcome to my personal learning repo for **Engineering Simulations** using tools like **ANSYS**, with a focus on:

- 🧪 FEA (Finite Element Analysis)
- 🌊 CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
- 🧱 Meshing, boundary conditions, and physics

This journey is based on the **Cornell University "Hands-On Introduction to Engineering Simulations"** course and other great resources.

## 🎯 Goal of This Repo

- Understand **how simulations work**
- Learn to use tools like ANSYS **with confidence**
- Avoid “garbage in, garbage out” by learning what’s happening inside the software

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Markdown for notes
- ANSYS 16.2 for simulations
- Git & GitHub for version tracking
