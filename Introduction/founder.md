## 🎯 What Problem Did He Solve?

John Swanson solved a **real engineering problem**:

> He wanted to know:
> **"If I put force on this part, will it break?"**

This is a **stress concentration problem** — meaning:

* A certain spot on the part gets **extra stress** when you push or pull on it.
* That spot might **crack** or **fail** if you don’t design it right.

## 🧪 Example (Imagine This):

Think of a **metal ring** with a **hole** in it.

When you pull on the ring:

* The edges of the hole get **more stress** than the rest of the ring.
* That spot is a **stress concentration area** — a weak spot.

John wanted to **calculate** that stress:

* How much stress is in the metal?
* Where is the stress the highest?
* Will it bend, stretch, or break?

## ❌ The Problem at the Time

Back in the 1960s:

* There was **no software** to help with this.
* You had to do **manual math**, which was **very slow and limited**.

## ✅ What John Did

He:

1. **Built a mini program** that used springs to **simulate stress** on that shape.
2. **Wrote computer code** using punch cards.
3. Ran the program to see how the stress was spread.
4. Showed it to others — they said it looked **really good**.

This small tool grew into something bigger:
🔧 **ANSYS**, a software that helps engineers **simulate** stress, heat, flow, etc., **before building anything.**

---

## 🔁 In Short:

* 🧠 He had a **real problem**: How does force affect a part?
* 📐 He made a **simulation** to solve it.
* 💻 He turned it into a **tool that others could use**.
* 🌍 That tool became **ANSYS**, now used by engineers everywhere.
